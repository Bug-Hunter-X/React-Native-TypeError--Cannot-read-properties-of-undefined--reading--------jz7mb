This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components are rendered before data has loaded. For instance, consider the following code:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('some-api-endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text> {/* Potential error here */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

If the API request hasn't completed, `this.state.data` will be `null`, causing a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')`.
